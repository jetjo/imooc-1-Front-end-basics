    Determining with absolute accuracy whether or not a JavaScript object is an array
  </a>
</h2>

<h3>Typing problems in JavaScript</h3>

<p>JavaScript's <code>typeof</code> operator is well known to have confusing behavior:
  <code>typeof null === "object"</code>, and <code>typeof null !== 
"null"</code>. This mistake trips up newcomers, and every so often it'll trip up a seasoned yet forgetful veteran, but
  we've basically grown used to it.
  Perhaps more important, there's a failsafe workaround: simply compare directly as <code>v === null</code> to eliminate
  <code>null</code> from the
  possibilities under consideration.
</p>

<h3>Determining whether a value is an array</h3>

<p><code>typeof null === "object"</code> is perhaps the most common typing mistake in JavaScript, but there are others
  as well. A much less common but no
  less confusing problem is that of determining whether an object is an array. Surely, say you, this is a simple problem
  with a simple solution, like
  so:</p>

<pre>
if (o instanceof Array)
{
  // <span title="Hey, a rhyme!  jorendorff, are you reading this?  ;-)">Oh frabjous day!</span>
}
</pre>

<p>Under certain circumstances, the above code is perfectly functional; considering the history of the web, it's not
  surprising the issue wasn't quickly
  apparent. The problem arises when one considers an aspect of JavaScript in browsers not contemplated by ECMAScript:
  multiple globals.</p>

<p>The ECMAScript specification describes the environment and mechanisms involved in executing a string of code. The
  syntax and basic semantics of
  language constructs are certainly important, but without the built-in methods and objects coding in ECMAScript
  wouldn't be much fun. These methods and
  objects are accessed through the global object, and it is here where things go astray. The ECMAScript 3 environment
  implicitly assumes the existence of a
  single global (or, perhaps, of islands each of which is its own environment, with no interaction between them) and
  does not in any manner address the idea
  of multiple globals.</p>

<p>Multiple globals, however, are fundamental to the browser; each <code>window</code> object is the global object for
  the scripts its page contains or
  references. What about arrays in different windows? The shared-mutation hazard of having arrays in two coordinating
  windows be instances of the same
  <code>Array</code> constructor, sharing the same <code>Array.prototype</code>, is enormous when either page augments
  <code>Array.prototype</code> (not to
  mention the security problems when one page is malicious!), so <code>Array</code> and <code>Array.prototype</code> in
  each window must be different.
  Therefore, by the semantics of <code>instanceof</code>, <code>o instanceof Array</code> works correctly only if
  <code>o</code> is an array created by that
  page's original <code>Array</code> constructor (or, equivalently, by use of an array literal in that page). <span
    title="NB: this is a valid word in 
Scrabble &mdash; play it!">Pfui</span>.
</p>

<p>Are there any other methods of determining whether a value is an array that might work around this?
  <code>o.constructor === Array</code> is one, with
  the same problem as an <code>instanceof</code> check. Another option relies on so-called "duck typing", where if a
  value
  <del>quacks</del><ins>looks</ins> like <del>a duck</del><ins>an array</ins> then it <em>is</em> <del>a
    duck</del><ins>an array</ins>. Along the
  <code>constructor</code>-checking lines, you could check for other array methods like <code>push</code> or
  <code>concat</code>, or perhaps for a
  <code>length</code> property, but these properties could exist in the same fashion on a non-array object. If you're
  willing to have false positives and
  negatives (assuming unconstrained input) that might be acceptable, but of course that won't always be the case. One
  test in this style is
  <code>Object.prototype.toString.call(o) === "[object Array]"</code>, but that relies on
  <code>Object.prototype.toString</code> and
  <code>Function.prototype.call</code> not being changed (probably a good assumption but still fragile). It's also a bit
  more of an obvious hack than any
  of the other ideas.
</p>

<h3>Enter <code>Array.isArray</code></h3>

<p>For these reasons, ECMAScript 5 defines a method, <code>Array.isArray</code>, to completely address the problem. If
  the first argument provided is an
  array object created in any window at all, it returns <code>true</code>; if no arguments were provided or if the first
  argument wasn't an array object, it
  returns <code>false</code>.</p>

<pre>
function test(fun, expect) { if (fun() !== expect) alert("FAIL: " + fun); }
test(function() { return Array.isArray([]); }, true);
test(function() { return Array.isArray(new Array); }, true);
test(function() { return Array.isArray(); }, false);
test(function() { return Array.isArray({ constructor: Array }); }, false);
test(function() { return Array.isArray({ push: Array.prototype.push, concat: Array.prototype.concat }); }, false);
test(function() { return Array.isArray(17); }, false);
Object.prototype.toString = function() { return "[object Array]"; };
test(function() { return Array.isArray({}); }, false);
test(function() { return Array.isArray({ __proto__: Array.prototype }); }, false);
test(function() { return Array.isArray({ length: 0 }); }, false);

var w = window.open("about:blank");
w.onload = function()
{
  test(function() { return Array.isArray(arguments); }, false);
  test(function() { return Array.isArray(new w.Array); }, true);
};
</pre>

<p>Does this method provide any additional functionality beyond the hacks? One important use is for implementing
  variadic methods. Consider, for
  example, MochiKit's <a
    href="http://mochikit.com/doc/html/MochiKit/Base.html#fn-flattenarray"><code>MochiKit.Base.flattenArray</code></a>
  method, whose
  documentation states that it:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Return a new Array consisting of every item in lst with Array items expanded in-place recursively. This differs
    from flattenArguments in
    that it only takes one argument and it only flattens items that are instanceof Array.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you happen to be writing JavaScript that crosses window boundaries passing around arrays, you're out of luck
  trying to use
  <code>flattenArray</code>. From the <a href="http://mochikit.com/examples/interpreter/index.html">MochiKit
    interpreter</a>, note the <code>instanceof 
Array</code> check, with a little reformatting:
</p>

<pre>
&gt;&gt;&gt; MochiKit.Base._flattenArray.toSource()
(function (res, lst) {
  for (var i = 0; i &lt; lst.length; i++) {
    var o = lst[i];
    if (o instanceof Array) {
      arguments.callee(res, o);
    } else {
      res.push(o);
    }
  }
  return res;
})
</pre>

<p>This is currently <em>cross-window FAIL</em>. :-) MochiKit can't actually implement exactly what a strict reading of
  its documentation would claim.
  Using <code>Array.isArray</code> with a feature-detection guard, however, will make it work correctly on arrays not
  from the window in which MochiKit.Base
  is being used.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that MochiKit's not the only framework out there that tries to hackily determine whether a value is
  an array. Dojo, for example, has
  <a href="http://docs.dojocampus.org/dojo/isArray#caveats"><code>dojo.isArray</code></a> with similar limitations, and
  I suspect this is a common problem
  across many JS codebases.
</p>

<h3>When can I use it?</h3>

<p>Technically, the answer to this question is: as soon as you want! The usual feature-testing for
  <code>Array.isArray</code> allows you to use this
  method if it exists and ignore it if it doesn't. You will be able to <em>meaningfully</em> use it, however, starting
  with Firefox 3.6. WebKit nightlies
  have also added support for it, so it will presumably be in future Safari and Chrome releases. I don't know about
  other vendors, but
  <code>Array.isArray</code>'s utter triviality to implement (it was a 15-line patch for Mozilla with no complexity
  whatsoever, and a good bit of that was
  SpiderMonkey coding idioms) suggests that if you ask, they will provide.
